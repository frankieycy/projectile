## Projectile

* motor cyclist under power-law air resistance
* resistance: $ \vec{f} = - k v^{\beta} \vec{v} $
* examine traj under diff beta values
* intuitively high beta means motion is heavily resisted

## Results

* see `xy.png`
* traj for beta = 0.33 & 1.00 are plotted
* as expected, higher beta gives a shorter range and lower max height
